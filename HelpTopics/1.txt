**General Commands**
_%prefix%start_
	Start the game as the defender. This can be used by the winner of the previous game,
    or any user if the winner opened the game by typing _%prefix%open_.
    Otherwise, anyone can request the spot by issuing this command, but they will
    need confirmation from the winner (who will use _%prefix%confirm_ or _%prefix%deny_).
_%prefix%open_
    If you won the previous game, allow anyone to start the next one (by default,
    you have the priority).
_%prefix%sh[ow]_
	Show the current game status.
_%prefix%s[tatus]_
    Show the short version of %prefix%show.
_%prefix%ismod [user]_
	Check if you, or _user_ if specified, are a moderator in this guild.
_%prefix%help [page]_
	List available commands.
